category: documentation

You have probably read about the [release of the OpenAPI Documentation](https://openbuildservice.org/2023/06/06/openapi-documentation/).
That doesn't mean the documentation is finished and static. On the contrary,
we have recently introduced a few more endpoints and are looking forward to your contributions.

Please check them out!

* [Statistics](https://api.opensuse.org/apidocs/#/Statistics)
* [Status Project](https://api.opensuse.org/apidocs/#/Status%20Project)
* [Status Reports - Required Checks](https://api.opensuse.org/apidocs/#/Status%20Reports%20-%20Required%20Checks)
* [Status Reports](https://api.opensuse.org/apidocs/#/Status%20Reports)
* [Build](https://api.opensuse.org/apidocs/#/Build)
