title: "Request Workflow Redesign: RPM Lint Results Filtering"
category: development
---

In the effort to bring the full release of this feature sooner, we continued our work on request workflow redesign with a small batch of changes and improvements. 
You can try these enhancements right now and bring us much needed feedback, as we inch closer to replacing the workflow with the new design.
In this roundup, we bring one more feature to the RPM Lint page introduced earlier this month.

The request redesign is part of [the beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

## RPM Lint Filtering

With the new RPM Lint page, come new possibilities. Since we now display a cumulative summary of multiple RPM Lint reports, we also have the ability to allow users to specify which of them they want to see.

With this, we hope that RPM Lint page becomes even more valuable, and that it makes it easier for you to use the build service.
