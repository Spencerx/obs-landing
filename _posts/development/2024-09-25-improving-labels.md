title:  Improving Labels to Foster Collaboration
category: development
---

Not long ago, we introduced several new features in OBS designed to foster collaboration among users.
Today, weâ€™re excited to announce a series of improvements to the newly introduced labels feature, which will help you better work with your projects and packages.

These updates are part of the `Foster Collaboration` and `Labels` beta programs. You can find more information about the beta program [here](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### Adding Labels to the List of Packages of a Project

First, you set the labels for a package.
Next, you expect those labels to be shown in the list of packages of a project.
And, why not? You'd expect to filter by those labels.
Now, you can do just that!

### Showing Labels in the List of Requests

The same logic applies to requests.
First, you set the labels for a request.
From now on, those labels are shown in the list of Requests.
Enjoy!

### Labels Creation and Selection Improvements

We have not only improved the way labels are displayed, but also how they are created, assigned and managed.

#### Improved Selection of Labels

We have streamlined the label selection process, reducing the number of clicks required when using the label selector.
It's as simple as it looks!

#### Introducing Copy of Labels from One Project to Another

It could be handy to copy labels from another project.
This option is now available in the "Label templates" section of your project.

#### Automatically Suggesting a Color When Creating a New Label

To save you time, a color is automatically selected when you create a new label.

### Bonus: Preview Box for Editing the Description of Projects and Packages

We also have refined a feature introduced not long ago.
From now on, you can preview any changes you make in the descriptions of projects and packages.
You'll quiclky see how convinient this is when you start experimenting with the supported markdown.
