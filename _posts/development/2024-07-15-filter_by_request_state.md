title: Notifications Filter by Request State
category: development
---

We have heard your suggestions and have introduced a way to filter the requests-related notifications by request state.
This new filter will help you focus on what really requires your attention.

### Filter by Request State

If you are involved in highly active projects or packages, you have probably received many notifications about accepted or declined requests
at the moment you check your inbox.
However, at that point, you might be more interested in those requests that still need your attention, like those in _new_ or _review_ state.

With the new filter by request state, you can easily select those that are relevant for you or quickly mark the rest as read.

### Reduce the Number of Notifications about the Same Topic

Have you noticed that the number of notifications has not increased as fast as it used to?
There is nothing wrong, on the contrary, a few days ago we improved the feature to only display the most recent notification about a certain topic.

For example, if someone adds you as a project's maintainer, then removes you by mistake and adds you again, only one notification will stay on your notifications page, the most recent one about the latest addition.

Enjoy a less-packed notifications page!
