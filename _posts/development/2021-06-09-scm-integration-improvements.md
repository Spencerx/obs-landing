OBS will rebuild your packages when new changes are detected in an opened PR/MR.

## Build results for repository and architecture and multibuilds
OBS will report back to your PR/MR the build results for each repository and architecture combination for a package.
It also supports multibuilds so it will show the build status of all the flavours of a package.
