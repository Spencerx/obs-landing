title: Improvements for the Continuous Integration with OBS and GitHub/GitLab
category: development
---

Today, we have some improvements for the continuous integration we unveiled in our [previous blog post](https://openbuildservice.org/2021/05/31/scm-integration/).

## Updates on a PR/MR

OBS will trigger the workflow again when new changes are detected in an opened PR/MR. It will rebuild your branched packages when pushing new commits, basically.

## Build Results for Repository and Architecture

Maybe you had a workflow set for a package built against several distributions and architectures. OBS was reporting all build results, but we were showing only the last one on the checks section of a PR/MR. Now OBS shows the build results for each repository and architecture combination of any package.

It will appear in the PR/MR checks section as another check, with the build status reported like this (GitHub in this example):

<figure>
	<img src="/images/posts/blog-post-about-reporting-repositories-architectures-and-reacting-to-updates-in-a-pr/2021-06-10_15-29.png" alt="Build results for a package" />
	<figcaption>Build results for a package</figcaption>
</figure>
	
If your package builds several flavours, the check will have the flavour name appended to the package name:

	âœ“ OBS: ctris:hans - openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64
	
TODO: Add screenshots of an actual checks section

## Current Limitations

Right now, we only act on events coming from webhooks configured on [GitHub.com](https://github.com) or [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com).
