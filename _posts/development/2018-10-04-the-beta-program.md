# What Does the Beta Program Include?

As the beta program includes the very new unreleased features, what it includes will change from time to time.
We blog about the current and upcoming changes to be included in the beta program.
Read our recent blog posts to stay up to date on this matter.

# How to Join the Beta Program?

Joining the beta program is really easy!
Be sure to be logged in, then go on [your profile page](https://build.opensuse.org/home) and click on the _Manage Beta Features_ link under _Actions on this page_.
On mobile, the link is under the _Actions_ menu.

That's it! You're now part of the beta program. By default, all beta features are enabled as soon as you join the beta program.
You can disable a specific beta feature if you want, simply click on its switch.
Enabling back a beta feature is always possible if you change your mind later.

And of course, you can leave the beta program at any time by clicking again on the _Beta program_ switch on the _Manage Beta Features_ page.

# How to Provide Feedback?

Is something broken?
Are there some flaws in a workflow?
Do you have some improvements in mind?
Let us know!
You just need to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md).
Describe the problem and explain how to reproduce it.
The more details you add, the better: screenshots, the URL of the page, etc.
Do not forget to mention that you have joined the beta program.

Before opening an issue, it is a good idea to check [the issues list](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"Frontend") to avoid reporting a problem, which someone else has already reported.
In case you have more information about an already opened issue, please add a comment with your findings.
