# How to Provide Feedback?

Is something broken?
Are there some flaws in a workflow?
Do you have some improvements in mind?
Let us know!
You just need to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md).
Describe the problem and explain how to reproduce it.
The more details you add, the better: screenshots, the URL of the page, etc.
Do not forget to mention that you have joined the beta program.

Before opening an issue, it is a good idea to check [the issues list](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Frontend+%F0%9F%91%BB%22) to avoid reporting a problem, which someone else has already reported.
In case you have more information about an already opened issue, please add a comment with your findings.
