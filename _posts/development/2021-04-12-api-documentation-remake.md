Following our previous work on the [API Documentation](/2021/01/26/api-documentation-remake), we focused this time on documenting some OBS API endpoints with [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

In the last days we documented Build and Workers related endpoints. Stay tuned, that's just the beginning!

This documentation page is now available [here](https://build.opensuse.org/apidocs-new/).

We still have a lot to do in this area. However, after every sprint where we review the actual documentation, dig into code, play around with the API, and migrate the documentation to the OpenAPI standard, we don't just come up with a better looking documentation, but we learn more about our API itself too.

As always, we kindly ask you to navigate through the new API documentation, try it, and let us know about your experience.
