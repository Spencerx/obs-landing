category: development
---

After a while keeping working on the request page redesign, we are glad to come back to you with two new request types: maintenance incident requests and maintenance release requests.

The request redesign is part of [the beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### What are Maintenance Incident Requests and Maintenance Release Requests?

Maintenance incident requests and maintenance release requests are two different types of OBS requests used in a maintenance update process, typically when a distribution is already frozen and needs to recieve updates.
This is explained in detail in the "Maintenance Support" section of the [OBS User documentation](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.maintenance_setup.html).
