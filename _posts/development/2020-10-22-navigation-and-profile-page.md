title: Navigation and Profile Page Redesign
category: development
---

On our quest to improve usability, we've been tuning various parts of OBS. This
time, we've worked on the navigation and redesigned the profile page. All of this
is available in the beta program, so be sure to [join](https://openbuildservice.org/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/)
if you haven't done so already!

# To Collapse, or Not To Collapse?

Well, this is the choice you have now with the left side navigation. We believe
this will increase usability for anyone using OBS on devices with smaller screens.

Those changes were implemented after gathering feedback following up the release
of our [previous blog post on the left side navigation](https://openbuildservice.org/2020/08/17/left-side-navigation/).

# Whole Lotta Love for the Profile Page

All you need is love... this is definitely what the profile page needed! With
this new design, the page looks much nicer on all devices, especially on those
with smaller screens.

Ever wondered how a user is involved in projects or packages? This is a lot
easier to find out now with the reworked `Involved Projects/Packages` tab.
Simply use the `Role` filter and voil√†, you know if they are the maintainer,
reviewer or more.

In addition to your avatar, the new biography field allows you to personalize
your profile page with a short text. Be creative, the sky is the limit!

Here's how it looks on mobile:
