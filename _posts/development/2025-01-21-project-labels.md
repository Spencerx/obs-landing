We worked diligently to bring you the next set of improvements to the ways to collaborate in OBS.
With that we are happy to announce you will now be able to label all of your projects and subprojects,
to allow yourself and other users better understand what purpose they serve at a glance. 

These updates are part of the `Labels` beta program. You can find more information about the beta program [here](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### Labeling Projects

As part of the `Labels` beta program, we expanded the labels to also cover projects.
To accomplish this, we introduced Project Labels, which allow OBS administrators
to set up labels on their instance of OBS in the Admin Configuration.

After the creation of Project Labels, maintainers of projects can add and remove labels in all of their projects.

This also allows filtering to happen for all projects at the same time, which we allow you to do on the All Projects page.
