title: Updates to the Request Index Page
category: development

A few months ago, we introduced the Request Index Page feature in OBS. Recently, we added new filters to help users narrow down requests by staging projects and by request creators. The filters have also been improved to consider reviews, which is particularly useful for finding staging project requests.

The `Request Index` feature is part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### Filter requests by creator

We understand that users often deal with a large number of requests, making it challenging to locate a specific request. To simplify this process, we have introduced a new filter that allows you to narrow down requests by creator.

### Filter requests by staging projects

In addition, we have introduced a filter to search by staging projects. This allows you to focus your search results specifically on requests related to staging projects.

### Inclusion of reviews in requests search

Previously, some requests were excluded from search results because they lacked a clear direction (incoming or outgoing) but still involved users, projects, or packages due to requested reviews. To resolve this, we now include reviews in the search process, significantly improving filtering for staging project requests.
