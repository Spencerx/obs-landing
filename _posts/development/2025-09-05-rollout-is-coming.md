title: "The New Request Workflow is Going Live!"
category: development
---

Starting Thursday, September 11th, we will begin rolling out the new request workflow.
We believe, the redesign we've been working on for a long time together with you, is now mature enough to go live.
So some of you will begin to see the new user interface from that moment on.
We appreciate your patience as we all get used to the new workflow.

## Phased Rollout

A phased rollout means we will not enable the new feature for all users at once, we will do it gradually.
This means you might receive the update sooner or later than your colleagues.
This rollout strategy prevents a large-scale impact if unforeseen problems occur.

## Get Early Access

The request workflow redesign is still part of our beta program. If you're curious and want to try it out now, you can enable the feature at any time.

Join the [beta program](https://build.opensuse.org/my/beta_features) and enable the _Request workflow redesign_ feature to familiarize yourself with it as soon as possible.
