### Canned Responses UI

Canned Responses are listed as cards in a more convenient design. As they can still be edited or deleted, the create form is now hidden until you click on the `Create Canned Response` button, and the form will appear.

### Report Overview Details

Moderators will now see more in-depth information about a report and reported content in the report view.

 - the page presents now the reason why the report has been submitted by someone
 - if no decision has been taken yet, there is box at the bottom to take the decision right away
 - if the decision has already been taken, the report view presents the details for that
