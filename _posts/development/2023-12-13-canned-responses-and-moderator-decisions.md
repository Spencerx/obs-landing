title: Canned Responses and Moderator Decisions
category: development

Many reports can cover the same kind of violation of the rules, and handling it can be redundant. Moderators can customize their own set of canned responses in order to reuse them where they need it.

*Content Moderation* is part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### Appeal to Moderator Decisions

What happen after a non-ignore decision is done on a reported object? The author should be able to access the report decision in order to appeal to it. This is now possible from the notification received about an own comment being reported and moderated. See the picture below:
