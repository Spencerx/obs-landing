We're back with a couple of features and improvements that landed recently. Together with some performance enhancements, these updates, driven by your feedback, aim to improve your experience with the OBS notifications.

## Get What You Need

If you find yourself receiving a high volume of notifications, we highly recommend visiting [your subscriptions page](https://build.opensuse.org/my/subscriptions) to fine-tune what you see. This allows you to narrow down your notifications and ensure your feed is as relevant as possible.

## Notifications for Group Maintainers

To improve transparency, group maintainers will now receive a notification whenever a new user is added to their group. This ensures maintainers are always aware of changes to their group's composition, fostering better oversight and team management.

## Smarter Project Filtering for Notifications

We heard your feedback about the long, scrollable list of project names on the notifications filter. To make your life easier, we've replaced it with an autocomplete field. Start typing, and OBS will suggest projects, letting you quickly pinpoint the notifications you need to see.
