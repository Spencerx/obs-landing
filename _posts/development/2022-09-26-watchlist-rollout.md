title: The New Watchlist Came to Stay
category: development
---

We enabled the new watchlist feature in February 2022 under the beta program.
Since then, we have been improving this feature thanks to the valuable feedback coming from our users. Moving
forward today, we are now ready to push it out of the beta program and make it generally available in OBS.

### Watch projects, packages and requests!

OBS is huge and it is easy to lose track of important projects, packages, and requests.
The new watchlist solves this problem and helps you to keep track of your most used projects,
packages, and requests; unlike the old watchlist where you only could store projects.
The watchlist is available from every corner of the application,
which makes it easily accesible.

### Notifications and the new watchlist

There are many options available in notification settings. The new watchlist allows you to receive
notifications for different events related to your watched projects, packages, and requests. For example,
if someone adds a comment to the request you are watching. These settings can be changed in `Change Your Notifications` menu.

If you haven't got a chance to use it yet, please give it a try.
