title: Build Results Summary Chart Links to Build Results Overview

A quick update on the Request Page Redesign: the build summary chart bars are now clickable.

A simple click on the bar will open an overview of the builds, which will be displayed under the _Build Results_ tab on the request page and will have the corresponding filters applied.

You can see a build summary chart on the request page only when the submitted packages build against a long list of repositories.

If you are curious what we talking about, the Request Workflow Redesign is part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).
Give it a try and let us know what you think.
