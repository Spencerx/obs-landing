category: development
---

In our latest iteration towards an even more user-friendly experience, we're excited to share three key enhancements to our Request page. Get ready for a smoother and more informative ride!

### The Refresh Button

Ever wished for a quick way to update build results without reloading the entire page? Your wish is granted! We've added a handy refresh button so getting the latest information is just a click away. The chart will auto-refresh itself every minute, so you will get the latest build status anyway!

### Patchinfo Page Insights

We've supercharged the patchinfo page! Alongside the essentials, we've integrated more insightful information like the affected binaries, the affected packages or the issues related to the patch.
Now it's easier to read the update details!

### Pay Attention to the Conversation Between People 

We've made the history items added by OBS itself a bit smaller, thus less important, to signal that it's not really part of the conversation between the people involved. Those item's details are also hidden by default.
