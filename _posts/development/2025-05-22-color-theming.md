title: Dark Mode Is Now Available for Everyone!
category: development
---

Last year, thanks to one of our most special collaborators, [Moisés](https://github.com/mdeniz),
we introduced a "Dark Mode" option for the Open Build Service (OBS) web interface.
You might remember the section titled
["Introducing the Dark Mode"](/2024/01/25/revamping-the-build-status-page-and-introducing-the-dark-mode/#introducing-the-dark-mode)
from one of our blog posts.
At that time, it was released under the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

Today, we’re happy to announce that the "Color Themes" switch is now available to everyone, including the "Dark Mode" theme, with no beta program required.


## A Smoother Experience, Day and Night

Since the launch of the "Color Themes" switch in the beta program, we've received a lot of positive feedback.
Whether you prefer "Dark Mode" for its appearance or for reducing eye strain, we’ve polished and stabilized it.

If you prefer to let your operating system decide, just choose "system".
OBS will then follow your device’s light or dark mode automatically.

## How to Enable It

Trying it out is as simple as selecting a theme from your settings, nothing else needed.
Just head to "Your Profile", click in "Edit", and select your "Theme":

  * system (automatically matches your device setting, default)
  * light
  * dark

After clicking on "Update", you will enjoy your new theme setting.
As always, your choice will be remembered across sessions.
That's it!


## What’s Next?

While the current "Dark Mode" implementation is stable, we believe there's still room for improvement.
If you spot something that looks odd, please don’t hesitate to reach out and let us know.

Thanks to everyone who tested the beta and provided valuable feedback.
Your input made this rollout possible.

Stay tuned for more UI improvements coming soon!
