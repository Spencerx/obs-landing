title: New Filters Added to the Request Index Page
category: development
---

We're continuously improving the request index page!
In addition to the filters we recently introduced, we've now added three more: priority, creation time, and reviewer.
Try them out and see how they enhance your workflow!

The `Request Index` feature is part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).
