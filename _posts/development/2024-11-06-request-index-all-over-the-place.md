title: Unified Page to List Requests
category: development
---

Recently we kicked off a new feature in OBS: a request index page.
It is unified for all the different places: the same UI is now also available in Project details page and in Package details page.

The `Request Index` feature is part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### List Requests

The "Task" place in the main menu is now gone to leave space to the new "Request" place
