title: 3 Improvements For Collaboration on the Request Page
category: development
---
Our recent redesign of the request page has introduced three significant improvements that make it easier for you to understand better their requests. Those improvements are part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

# More Clarity on the Diffs

The diff tab now shows small highlights (called eyecatchers) that show the exact change. Those eyecatchers will help you see what exactly is new or changed and allow you to focus better on those differences, making it easier to review the request.

# Streamlined Conversations

You'll notice that the review decision and the comment boxes are now combined into just one box. This will reduce the clutter on a request's conversation timeline and help you focus on _what_ you have to do, not _where_.

# Less Noise on the Builds

The build status of a request was showing a lot of information that was not really useful for you, like the "Excluded" state. Now it shows only relevant information to the changes. This will make easier for you to understand the state of the request and help you make a decision about it.

We hope those changes will help you focus better on the important bits of a request. As always we are eager to know what do you think about this!
