## Introduction

Alright! Here we go again! This time with some small improvements to the request workflow: "Accept and Forward" is now the default action for requests that can be forwarded, and we have removed the confusing colors from the icons in the Comments & History timeline when adding a review.

The request redesign is part of [the beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/). If you want to try them out, please join the program.

## The "Accept & Forward" Button

When you are reviewing a request that can be forwarded, the "Accept and Forward" button will now be the default action. This should make the review process faster and more intuitive. For requests that cannot be forwarded, the "Accept" button will remain the default action.

## Clearer History Timeline

We received feedback that the yellow dots in the history timeline were confusing. They used the same colors as the review status icons, which could suggest that the history entries were going to change their state. To avoid this confusion, we have removed the colors from the history timeline icons. This makes the timeline easier to understand at a glance.

## Conclusion

We believe these two small changes will make your life easier when working with requests. As always, we are looking forward to your feedback!
