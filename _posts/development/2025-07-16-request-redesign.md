As part of the ongoing redesign of the requests page, we’ve made two key improvements to make handling requests more intuitive and reliable.

The request redesign is part of [the beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

## Grouped “Accept” Actions

Different types of “Accept” actions are now presented within a single dropdown button.
This change reduces visual clutter and simplifies the decision-making process by clearly grouping related actions in one place.

## Accurate “Outdated” Label

We fixed a case where inline comments were incorrectly marked as “Outdated”.
The label now appears only when it truly reflects the comment’s context.

These enhancements are part of our ongoing efforts to redesign the requests page, bringing it closer to a more intuitive and streamlined experience.
