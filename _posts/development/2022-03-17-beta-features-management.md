title: Manage Your Beta Features
category: development

Did you join the beta program, but somehow wish you could disable a specific
beta feature? This is now possible with the new _Manage Beta Features_ page.

# What Changed Exactly?

Before, you joined the beta program and all beta features were enabled. If you
somehow didn't want a certain beta feature, you couldn't disable it. You had
to leave the beta program to disable all beta features. Now, you can manage
which beta feature is enabled or disabled.

# How Does It Work?

By default, all beta features are enabled as soon as you join the beta program.
To manage which beta feature is enabled or disabled, be sure to be logged in,
then visit the [Manage Beta
Features](https://build.opensuse.org/my/beta_features) page. There is a link to
this page on your [profile](https://build.opensuse.org/home) under the _Actions
on this page_ sidebar menu on desktop and the _Actions_ menu on mobile.

On that page, you can join or leave the beta program by clicking on the _Beta
program_ switch. Enabling or disabling is just the same, click on the switch of
the beta feature you wish to enable or disable.

# Stay Informed

Whenever the beta program changes, we announce those changes just like we do
here in this blog post. However, we have an entire blog post dedicated to the
[beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program), so be sure to read it if you
haven't already. That blog post is the definite reference on the beta program.
We keep it up-to-date.
