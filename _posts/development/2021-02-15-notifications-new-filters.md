title: New Filters for Notifications
category: development
---

Those of you enrolled in the [beta program](https://openbuildservice.org/2018/10/04/the-beta-program)
already know the Notifications page we introduced a while ago.
Recently we introduced two new filters: _Incoming Requests_ and _Outgoing Requests_.

## Filters Overview

During a normal day, you may receive a big amount of web notifications. The notifications filters are there
to the rescue, by narrowing down the result' to the notifications you are looking for.

Listening to your feedback, we have created a new pair of filters: _Incoming Requests_ and _Outgoing Requests_ filters.
This way, we are introducing the behaviour from the Tasks page, that many of you are used to and were missing also for
the Notifications area.

_Incoming Requests_ displays unread notifications related to Requests that others created in packages
where you are involved e.g. you are the maintainer.

_Outgoing Requests_ displays unread notifications related to requests which were created by yourself.

Let us know about your experience!
