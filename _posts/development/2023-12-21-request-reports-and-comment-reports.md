In order to be effective, the content moderation feature has to be featureful and streamlined, so now we expanded it with a new kind of reportable and an easier way to report creators of comments.

*Content Moderation* is part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### Reporting Requests

Users can create various kinds of content in OBS, which means that malicious people can do it too. We expanded the reporting feature by adding Request into the mix.

### Reporting a Comment Creator with the Comment

When reporting a comment, you likely want the moderators to also have a deeper look into the commenter. We expanded the report dialog to include that option as a simple checkbox.
