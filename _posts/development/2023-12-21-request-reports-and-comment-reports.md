In order to be effective, the content moderation feature has to be featureful and streamlined, so now we expanded it by a new kind of reportable and an easier way to report creators of comments.

*Content Moderation* is part of the [beta program](/2018/10/04/the-beta-program/).

### Reporting requests

Users can create various kinds of content in OBS, which means that spammers can do it too. We expanded the reporting feature by adding Request into the mix.

### Reporting a comment creator with the comment

Very often when reporting a comment, you might want the moderators to also have a deeper look into the commenter. We expanded the report dialog to include that option as a simple checkbox.
