# How To Give Us Feedback

There are two ways to reach us:

- On GitHub, by [opening an
  issue](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/new/choose)
  and / or [commenting on an already opened
  issue](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues).
- On IRC, by talking directly to us. We are in the channel
  `#opensuse-buildservice` on *Libera.Chat*.

Please note that we favor GitHub to gather feedback as it allows us to easily
keep track of the discussions.
