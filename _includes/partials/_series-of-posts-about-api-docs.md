_After kicking off the [API documentation remake](/2021/01/26/api-documentation-remake/) in January 2021, we've continued with the [Build and Workers endpoints](/2021/04/12/api-docs-workers-and-build/) in April 2021, we followed with [Sources Projects and Search endpoints](/2021/12/09/api-docs-sources-and-search/) in December 2021, we documented the [Search endpoints](/2022/08/29/api-docs-search/) in August 2022, we continued extending the [Projects and Packages Sources endpoints](/2022/10/10/more-api-docs-sources), in March 2023 we added more for [Packages and Files Sources endpoints](/2023/03/21/continuing-api-docs-sources) and, at the beginning of May 2023, we worked on [Comments, Status Messages and Staging endpoints](/2023/05/02/api-docs-comments-status-staging). It is in June 2023 when we make the [release of the new API documentation](/2023/06/06/openapi-documentation) followed by the documentation of [Statistics, Status Project and Status Reports endpoints, among others](/2023/06/12/api-docs-continuation)._
