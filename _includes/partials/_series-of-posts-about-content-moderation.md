_Our journey into [content moderation]((/2023/10/02/moderation)) began back in October 2023, initially addressing [comment locks and report categories](/2023/10/18/comment-locking-and-report-categories). Since then, we've expanded this feature to include [canned responses and moderator decisions](/2023/12/13/canned-responses-and-moderator-decisions), facilitating smoother [request reporting and the reporting of users from comments](/2023/12/21/request-reports-and-comment-reports). Following that, we've honed in on [optimizing canned responses and introducing various UI upgrades](/2024/03/06/content-moderation), Last time we focused on [improving the communication and decision making](/2024/04/30/content-moderation). This time we [improved the report notifications for moderators](/2024/08/27/content-moderation)._
