_We started off the [continuous integration between OBS and GitHub/GitLab](/2021/05/31/scm-integration/) in May 2021,
then [made some improvements](/2021/06/14/scm-integration-improvements/) in June 2021. We introduced advanced features like [reporting filters and support for self-hosted SCM](/2021/07/12/scm-integration-more-improvements) together with a list of [common pitfalls](/2021/07/12/scm-integration-pitfalls) in July 2021 and now, we added [two steps and a UI for tokens](/2021/08/02/link-package-configure-repositories-and-ui)._
