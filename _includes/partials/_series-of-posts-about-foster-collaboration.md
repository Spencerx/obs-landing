Our efforts to foster collaboration started in August 2024,
when we [introduced labels and bug report links](/2024/08/14/introduction-labels-and-foster-collab).
Next, we [improved labels to foster collaboration](/2024/09/25/improving-labels).
Then, we [focused on labeling projects](/2025/01/21/project-labels). In our last iteration,
we [expanded functionality of the labels with API](/2025/05/05/labels-api). Building on
that, we [introduced Assignments](/2025/05/15/foster-collaboration).
Most recently, weâ€™ve introduced [Release Monitoring](/2025/09/23/foster-collaboration).
