    <h2>In case of emergency...</h2>
    <p>
    Let's be honest, you might think differently but we're both not perfect (yet!). From time to time we make mistakes
    that end up as bugs in the OBS and it's also not unheard of that you need help to wrap your head around something
    in the OBS. But don't despair, as Free Software project we're commited to work together and collaborate.
    Here is how we do that.
    </p>

    <h3>we help each other out</h3>
    <p>
    There is a vibrant community of developers, admins and users that <b>support</b> each other in their usage of the OBS. They meet
    online in a the <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/openSUSE-buildservice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OBS IRC chat</a> or on the
    <a href="mailto:buildservice@lists.opensuse.org" rel="nofollow">OBS mailing list</a>
    (<a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/buildservice@lists.opensuse.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">archive</a>). Here you can ask questions
    if you have trouble understanding something, you can seek advice and mingle with other OBS community members.
    </p>

    <h3>we tell us about problems</h3>
    <p>
    In the unfortunate event you've hit a <b>bug</b> in the OBS we depend on you to report them. A bug can be a defect in the software,
    a wrong paragraph in the documentation, a dead link on the website or any other problem you are sure you can't do anything about.
    We track code bugs on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues" target="_blank">github</a>. Problems regarding the setup of distributions or with any other content of build.opensuse.org need to be reported either on the mailing lists or in <a href="https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/index.cgi" target="_blank">bugzilla</a>. If you need help entering an issue,
    github has a a great <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation" target="_blank">blogpost</a> about that.
    </p>

    <h3>we better ourselves</h3>
    <p>
    Sometimes it's not really a defect that is bugging you but missing functionality. You have an idea how to make OBS better, faster,
    stronger. Those ideas we call <b>feature</b> and we track them on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Commercial Support Offerings...</h2>
    <p>
      We ourselves currently have no product or service offering around OBS. But we are cooperating with preferred partners
      to allow customers using OBS in productive build environments. So if you need consulting, training or support with
